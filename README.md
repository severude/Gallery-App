# Gallery App with React

In this project, you'll build an image gallery using React and the Flickr API. After creating the project with create-react-app, you will build the gallery components, add to the supplied CSS and set up routing.

* (Recommended) Use the flickr.photos.search endpoint/method
* Display at least 3 links that return a list of photos matching some criteria. For example: Dogs, Cats and Coffee.
* Include a "Search" link that includes a search field to let users search for photos.
* Use React Router to set up routes for each navigation link in the directory app.
* You can use the Fetch API or a tool like Axios to fetch data from the Flickr API.
* You should do all data fetching from a container component that passes the data down to presentational components responsible for displaying images

# Setup Instructions

1) Create a config.js file in the src folder.  Paste in the following code inserting your own Flickr API Key.

```JavaScript
const apiKey = 'YOUR API KEY';
export default apiKey;
```


2) npm install - Installs all the build process dependencies.

3) npm start - Launches the app on port 3000
